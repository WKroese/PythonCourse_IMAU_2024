    "In climate science we often find ourselves with __gridded (array) data__, often in up to 4 dimensions: (latitude, longitude, height/depth/pressure, time). This can be model output, but also observed data. These datasets can be huge, for example, the monthly output of the high resolution Community Earth System Model is some 50 GB and that is for the ocean only!\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the data, e.g. temperatures, we also need to keep track of their locations and record other kinds of metadata. netCDF can store all of this information in a single, standardized file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we quote from the [NetCDF website](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/faq.html#whatisit):\n",
    "\n",
    ">NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is a set of interfaces for array-oriented data access and a freely distributed collection of data access libraries for C, Fortran, C++, Java, and other languages. The netCDF libraries support a machine-independent format for representing scientific data. Together, the interfaces, libraries, and format support the creation, access, and sharing of scientific data.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">NetCDF data is:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - Self-Describing. A netCDF file includes information about the data it contains.\n",
    "> - Portable. A netCDF file can be accessed by computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and floating-point numbers.\n",
    "> - Scalable. A small subset of a large dataset may be accessed efficiently.\n",
    "> - Appendable. Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.\n",
    "> - Sharable. One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same netCDF file.\n",
    "> - Archivable. Access to all earlier forms of netCDF data will be supported by current and future versions of the software.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part of this third tutorial will focus on working with the package `netCDF4`. This is based on the [NetCDF4 documentation](https://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/). You can use this package to __read and write NetCDF files__, but has no built in computations such as Pandas had. Here, we will focus on reading them only, which you will use most often.\n",
