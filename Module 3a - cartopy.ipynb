    "Once again, much was adapted from the great [Earth and Environmental Data Science](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/intro) cartopy tutorial which, in turn, adopted much from [Phil Elson](https://pelson.github.io/)'s excellent [Cartopy Tutorial](https://github.com/SciTools/cartopy-tutorial). Phil is the creator of Cartopy and published his tutorial under an [open license](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/), meaning that we can copy, adapt, and redistribute it as long as we give proper attribution. **THANKS PHIL!** 👏👏👏\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "Making maps is often a fundamental part of geoscience and climate research. But making maps is not straightforward:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maps require a *projection* of geographic coordinates on the 3D Earth to the 2D space of your figure.\n",
    "- Maps often include extra information besides just our data such as continents, country borders, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mapping is a notoriously hard and complicated problem, mostly due to the complexities of projection and the different possible approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we will learn about [Cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/), one of the most common packages for making maps within Python. Another popular and powerful library is [Basemap](https://matplotlib.org/basemap/); however, Basemap is [going away](https://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/intro.html#cartopy-new-management-and-eol-announcement) and being replaced with Cartopy in the near future. For this reason, new Python learners are recommended to learn Cartopy.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't alreay done so, install cartopy with\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda install cartopy`\n",
    "\n",
    "The STA from last year, Janneke, had some problems with her Cartopy installation, so I will put here how she solved it. You might encounter the same problems. First, there was a problem that not all packages were updated to the correct version. If you get an error, first uninstall cartopy with\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda uninstall cartopy`\n",
    "\n",
    "Then update all the packages with\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda update --all`\n",
    "\n",
    "Then re-install cartopy again with `conda install cartopy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For her, it still gave problems when she wanted to use cartopy, because if you use cartopy, it will download maps from a website and one of the paths was wrong. She got a 'Download error'. This was how she solved it\n",
    "\n",
    "She replaced line 313 in `/Users/janneke/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/cartopy/io/shapereader.py`\n",

    "\n",
    "So, in other words, we have to map a 3D sphere to a flat, 2D space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The major problem with map projections\n",
    "\n",
    "The surface of a sphere is topologically different to a 2D surface, therefore we *have* to cut the sphere *somewhere*.\n",
    "This means that a sphere's surface cannot be represented on a plane without distortion. See for example this orange:\n",

    "There are many different ways to make a projection, and we will not attempt to explain all of the choices and tradeoffs here. Instead, you can read Phil's [original tutorial](https://github.com/SciTools/cartopy-tutorial/blob/master/tutorial/projections_crs_and_terms.ipynb) for a great overview of this topic.\n",
    "Instead, we will very briefly discuss a few projections and then we will dive into the more practical sides of Cartopy usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two common approaches are:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. By [2D] surface classification\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preserving metric: Conformal\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many metrics that can be conserved: angles, areas and distance or combinations of these two. Here, we only want to discuss briefly the conformal projection, which is also known as Orthomorphic.\n",
    "\n",
    "These projections preserve angles locally. Implying that circles anywhere on the Earth's surface map to circles of *varying size* in the projected space.\n",

    "## Using Cartopy\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details see the [Cartopy documentation](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cartopy makes use of a powerful library for coordinate transformations called [PROJ.4](https://proj4.org/). It also uses Numpy and shapely libraries and includes a programatic interface built on top of Matplotlib for the creation of publication quality maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of Cartopy are its object oriented projection definitions, and its ability to transform points, lines, vectors, polygons and images between those projections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cartopy Projections and other reference systems\n",
    "\n",
    "In Cartopy, each projection is a class.\n",
    "Most classes of projection can be configured in projection-specific ways, although there are some exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a Plate Carree projection instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we need Cartopy's crs module. This is typically imported as ``ccrs`` (Cartopy Coordinate Reference Systems)."
